# TV_Class
This repository holds the answer to problem:
Create a Python Code for creating the Class named TV and a Test Driver program named TestTV that will create two objects from Class TV
## Installation of pyfiglet
- pyfiglet is a full port of FIGlet (http://www.figlet.org/) into pure python.
- To install the pyfiglet module through pip installer from command prompt shell, we first have to open the command prompt terminal of our system and write down the following command in it:
```
pip install pyfiglet
```
## Installation of Termcolor
 - Change Text Color. To add color to our stylish text, we can combine pyfiglet and termcolor to create pretty text. 
 - To change the text color, we use a Python library called termcolor. To install termcolor, use:
 ```
 pip install termcolor
 ```
 ## Installation of Curses
 - The curses library supplies a terminal-independent screen-painting and keyboard-handling facility for text-based terminals; such terminals include VT100s, the Linux console, and the simulated terminal provided by various programs. Display terminals support various control codes to perform common operations such as moving the cursor, scrolling the screen, and erasing areas. Different terminals use widely differing codes, and often have their own minor quirks.
 - For more information kindly visit (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html)
 ```
 pip install windows-curses
 ```
 ## Installation of Asciimatics
 - Asciimatics is a package to help people create full-screen text UIs (from interactive forms to ASCII animations) on any platform. It is licensed under the Apache Software Foundation License 2.0.
 - Asciimatics supports Python version 3. For the precise list of tested versions, refer to pypi. The last version of asciimatics to support Python 2 is v1.14.

To install asciimatics, simply install with pip as follows:
```
pip install asciimatics
```
This should install all your dependencies for you. If you don't use pip or it fails to install them, you can install the dependencies directly using the packages listed in requirements.txt. Additionally, Windows users (who aren't using pip) will need to install pywin32.
